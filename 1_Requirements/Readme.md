# Introduction

# Title: Chess Board using C

This project helps to developing game sector in Chess by using C programming.

# Approach: 

We will create a Chess Board with the help below functions:

1.rectangle(left, top, right, bottom): A function from graphics.h header file which is used to draw a rectangle. Coordinates of the left top and right bottom corners are required to draw the rectangle. left specifies the X-coordinate of the top left corner, top specifies the Y-coordinate of the top left corner, right specifies the X-coordinate of the right bottom corner, bottom specifies the Y-coordinate of the right bottom corner.

2.delay(): This function is present in library “dos.h” is used for holding the program output for a small period of time since processing is very fast so use it to see the result.

3.setcolor(): A function from graphics.h header file which sets the color of the pointer (cursor). There are some predefined colors in computer graphics. Here n is the color number.

4.setfillstyle(): A function from graphics.h header file which sets the current fill pattern and fill color.

5.floodfill(): A function from graphics.h header file which is used to fill an enclosed area.
  
# Objectives:

Use enum s to give names to numbers.

Define a struct to combine chess piece type and color.

Don't use nested functions.

Use switch -statements where appropriate.

Move more code into separate functions.

Be consistent when naming functions and variables.

Add whitespaces to make the structure of your code more clear.

# Explaination:

A standard chess set has 32 pieces, 16 per side. These pieces are sometimes called chessmen, but most experienced players refer to their pieces as “material.” The rules of chess govern how each piece is placed, how each piece moves across what number of squares, and whether there are any special moves permitted.


# Who:

•	C programming is used to maintain the line parameters whose main focus on constructing Chess game moves.

# What:

•	Many Transmission Line are inefficient due to prolonged time for testing the efficiency of the transmission line manually.This project gives the oopurtunity to compute all the required parameters and deploy into real world with more efficiency

# When:

•	With the increasing surfaces chess move & parameters change exponentially.

•	With the increase in line parameters,increased the problem to design the efficient way to suitable pieces moves for chesss game.

# Where:

•	This problem is surfaced in chess game in all 8*8=64 parameters .

# How:

•	This project takes in all the design input values and yields out the Line parameters.
