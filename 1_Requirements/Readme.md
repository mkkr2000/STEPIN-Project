# Introduction

# Title: Chess Board using C

This project helps to developing game sector in Chess by using C programming.
  
# Objectives:

Use enum s to give names to numbers.

Define a struct to combine chess piece type and color.

Don't use nested functions.

Use switch -statements where appropriate.

Move more code into separate functions.

Be consistent when naming functions and variables.

Add whitespaces to make the structure of your code more clear.

# Explaination:

A standard chess set has 32 pieces, 16 per side. These pieces are sometimes called chessmen, but most experienced players refer to their pieces as “material.” The rules of chess govern how each piece is placed, how each piece moves across what number of squares, and whether there are any special moves permitted.


# Who:

•	C programming is used to maintain the line parameters whose main focus on constructing Chess game moves.

# What:

•	Many Transmission Line are inefficient due to prolonged time for testing the efficiency of the transmission line manually.This project gives the oopurtunity to compute all the required parameters and deploy into real world with more efficiency

# When:

•	With the increasing surfaces chess move & parameters change exponentially.

•	With the increase in line parameters,increased the problem to design the efficient way to suitable pieces moves for chesss game.

# Where:

•	This problem is surfaced in chess game in all 8*8=64 parameters .

# How:

•	This project takes in all the design input values and yields out the Line parameters.
